This code explains a complete pipeline for detecting fraudulent job descriptions using BERT-based text classification. It includes preprocessing, tokenization, training with Hugging Face's Trainer API, and evaluation through confusion matrix and accuracy metrics. The model is trained on a labeled dataset with balanced classes and showcases predictions on sample test data. The implementation uses libraries such as transformers, datasets, evaluate, sklearn, and NLTK.
